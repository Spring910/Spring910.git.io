title: My first blog about the digital archive
---

The digital archive introduced here is the National Archives of UK. 

It was established in 2003, combined 4 government bodies. Its four combined departments are:
1)the Public Record Office, created as a result of the Public Record Office Act dedicated to preserving key public records and making them accessible to researchers

2)the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, appointed under Royal Warrant in 1869, performs the Historical Manuscripts Commission’s functions in relation to private records

3)Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, founded in 1786, holder of Crown copyright and official printer of all Acts of Parliament since 1889

4)the Office of Public Sector Information, created in 2005 following a European Union directive to promote the re-use of information produced and collected by public sector organisations

The National Archives are a non-ministered department, and the official archive and publishers for the UK government, and for England and Wales, therefore, it is entitled to be the guardians if over 1000 years of iconic national documents.

This archive preserves information for the future and provide guide for other organizations (other museums, galleries and archives), helps students of all ages to work on their research and studies, and manages crown copyright on behalf of government. The archives have separate education module which includes lessons, workshops, professional development and special classes for teachers and students.

The creation of the archive mainly relies on efforts of the UK government. As the official archive of the UK government and for England and Wales, it not lonely stores some normal publishments, but also hosts several databases on types of records including hospital records migration records and manorial records.

The National Archives divides its collections according to the letters. To find items easily, it exhibits some collections which are popular or searched frequently on its homepage and its latest events. It also uses image library to show digital version of its collections and divides categories based on contents. Unfortunately, the library charges different fees for reading those online image books.

When you search online, you will find the archive used Google map to provide visitors with more accessible help. Visitors can learn basic knowledge of the archive, how to go the archive based on Google map and Google Street View. It also uses archive media players to publish some educational films. What interested me most is its souvenir shop. The shop provides lots of products which are designed based on the collections of the archives, such as family history books, maps, jewellery and even clothes. To follow the technological development, The National Archives, in conjunction with historian Nick Barratt and smartphone applications development studio RevelMob developed its first Old Money iPhone app which uses historic price data from documents held at The National Archives to see what a sum of money from the past (from 1270) would be worth today and the spending power it would have commanded at the time. In September 2011, TNA's museum began using QRpedia codes, which can be scanned by smartphone users in order to retrieve information about exhibits from Wikipedia.
