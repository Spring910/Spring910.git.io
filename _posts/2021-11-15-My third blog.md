The National Gallery

The National Gallery is an art museum which exhibits paintings of the target period, from mid-13 century to 1900. Unlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalizing an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the British government bought 38 paintings from the heirs of John Julius Angerstein in 1824. After that initial purchase, the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, especially Charles Lock Eastlake, and by private donations, which now account for two-thirds of the collection. The collection is smaller than many European national galleries, but encyclopedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting “from Giotto to Cézanne” are represented with important works. It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition, but this is no longer the case.

The reason why I am so interested in this gallery is its style. I prefer oil paintings and this gallery shows artworks of one of my favorite painters, Monet. Meanwhile, the gallery mainly exhibits artworks of midcentury, so its website shows the painters in portraits instead of normal photographs. 

The website uses paintings as its background. When you click into it, you can immediately see the opening hours and address. It uses “plan your visit” to substitute normal “book tickets”, so you may feel curious to continue using the website, at least for me. Another main content of the homepage is the latest exhibitions and events, so it will attract more visitors to attend its recent activities.

When you use the navigation, there are some problems. The first is that it may take you several steps to get the results and the whole searching process is not simplistic. For example, for “art and artists” part, the website does not use simple labels to show its collections and it emphasize more on recent arrived artworks rather than much well-knowns. The second is the website system is not reliable, it would take more time to react with visitors’ orders.

Paintings shows their name, creators, and rooms in the gallery on the website. It is a wonderful design when the website shows the room number online, so it become super convenient for visitors to target the painting’s position. When you click into separate pages of individual paintings, you can see a larger size of the painting and you can resize it randomly to look for more details. There is also a simple description of the painting. Furthermore, you can find out information about the artist by clicking his or her name. You can download the image for further use.
