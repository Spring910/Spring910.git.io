Wildlife Photographer of the Year: Gallery Visit

Background 

Held in London, England, by the Natural History Museum, Wildlife Photography of the Year is an annual international wildlife photography competition. It has become the largest wildlife photography competition in the world. NHM will hold the exhibition to display the winning artworks and then the exhibition will tour around the worldwide. After 1992, a book of winners is published each year.

Layout

When you enter the website, you will see the ‘book tickets’ and ‘enter the competition’ first, so you may easily choose to watch the exhibition or participant in it. And then the website shows two grand title winners in adult group and young group. You can also know the recent popular searches on the homepage. When you set proper filter, the website shows results with two or three pictures in one row. Some pictures will be tagged as winners, so visitors can find those winning artworks directly. When you click individual photo and enter the subpages, you can see a bigger size of the image, its photography and other related filter labels.

Filter functionality

The filter shows different labels, such as dates, competition groups, award, categories, locations, species, and photographers. The website also provides the most popular filter combinations, so visitors can click those labels directly without setting by themselves.

Overall user experience (UX)

Here I will use several dimensions which affect UX.
1)	strength of visual content: When visitors enter the website, they will see the booking function first instead of winning images, and there are too many descriptive words used in the homepage instead of artworks. Therefore, visitors may lack interest in continuing using the website to browse pictures.
2)	Visual aesthetics: The color and graphics used on the website is harmoniously. The website mainly uses black and white to design and pictures they presented are mainly using dark colors, so the whole design is consistent. 
3)	System reliability and performance: The interface is fully functional and completely free of technical error. The pages consistently load quickly and respond immediately to users’ actions. However, the website is for photography exhibition and uses lots of images, so images need more time to load and sometimes cannot show with words at the same time.
4)	Usefulness of metadata: The website only provides basic information about the artworks and their photographers. But as a photography exhibition, it shows the specific information about the camera, lens and focal length.
5)	Interface usability: it is in the beginning level. The elements used in interface are too much, so it seems difficult to locate the target images. And it will take long time to distinguish different dimensions. The website may want to present many subjects at the same time, so it is difficult for me to grab the emphasize
6)	Support for casual and expert users: For casual users, the website provides basic information about the image and photographers. And for expert users, it provides specific information about the equipment, therefore, the expert users can try to get the similar image by using their own equipment.
7)	Integration of social features: Users can use the third party to access the exhibitions, such as ins, Facebook, and Twitter. The exhibition also has its own shop and users can use the third party of payment system to buy anything they want.
